# My-CPP-Libraries
Small set of libraries that I wrote myself to understand more about programming.

Written in C++/C/ASM Combined and will most probably be 100% cross platform

# Usage:

To use a library, all you need to do is just:

```cpp
#include "libary_name/library_name.h"
```

Example:
```cpp
#include "socket/socket.h"
```
